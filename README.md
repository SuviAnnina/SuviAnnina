### Hi friend! :slightly_smiling_face:  
Welcome to my GitHub corner! My name is Suvi.    
👉 I’m currently learning software development (frontend/fullstack) in [Haaga-Helia UAS](https://www.haaga-helia.fi/en). I'm about to graduate!  
✨ For my thesis I developed an online web-app with Vue.js for creative knitters which I'm very proud of; [KnitDesigner](https://github.com/SuviAnnina/KnitDesigner). It's live on [Netlify](https://knitdesigner.netlify.app/)!  
✨ I worked on the web-app [Helsinki East Aerodome Info Screen](https://github.com/EHA-Display-Terminal-Team/eha-infoscreen) with a team for a client. It's built with Next.js.  
  
👉 I’ve pinned other favourites of mine on my front page, but feel free to have a look at my other repos as well!  
  
❤️ The pup on my picture is my rescue dog Tessa.
