### Hi friend! :slightly_smiling_face:  
Welcome to my GitHub corner! My name is Suvi.    
:sparkles: I’m currently learning software development (fullstack) in [Haaga-Helia UAS](https://www.haaga-helia.fi/en).  
:sparkles: The adorable smoochy pupper on my picture is my rescue dog Tessa. She's very affectionate!  
:sparkles: I’m working on different kinds of frontend and backend projects both on my own, and as a part of a team. I’ve pinned my favourites on the front page, but feel free to have a little looksie of other repos as well! :wink:
